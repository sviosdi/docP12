# The ActivChart component

## The main dimensions

![The ActivChart geometry](/img/activities_geom.png)

We will define the main dimensions as follows :

- `hist_h` = the height of the histogram = the height of the selected rectangle
- `hist_h_kilo` = the height of the highest bar of kilos, that is `dep` pixels lower than `hist_h`. The highest bar of the calories will be `cal_dep` pixels higher.
- There are margins around the histogram :
  - `hist_top`, `hist_bottom`, `hist_left` and `hist_right`.
- There is an horizontal padding of `deb` pixels which is also the overflow of selection rectangle.
- Each bar will be 7 pixels wide with a gap of 8 pixels, so the bars will take 22 pixels and the selection rectangle will be 22 + 17\*2 = 56 pixels wide.

```javascript
const dep = 50; // vertical overflow in px of the selection rectangle in relation to the max kilo
const cal_dep = 25; // vertical overflow in px of the calo.max rectangle in relation to kilo.max
const deb = 17; //horizontal padding in px of the selection rectangle in relation to the max kilo
const hist_top = 112.5 - dep;
const hist_bottom = 62.5;
const hist_left = 43 - deb;
const hist_right = 90 - deb;
const hist_w = ref.current.clientWidth - (hist_right + hist_left);
const hist_h = ref.current.clientHeight - (hist_bottom + hist_top);
const hist_h_kilo = hist_h - dep;
const nbEl = activities.length;
const w = (hist_w - deb * 2 - 22) / (nbEl - 1); // The distance between two consecutive bars of kilos.
```

## Scaling

```javascript
ActiveChart.rangeKilo = getRange(activities, "kilogram");
ActiveChart.rangeCalo = getRange(activities, "calories");
const kilo_hscale = hist_h_kilo / (rangeKilo.max - rangeKilo.min + 1);
const calo_hscale = (hist_h_kilo + cal_dep) / rangeCalo.max;
```

If `rangeKilo.min` = 76 kg and `rangeKilo.max` = 81 kg, we will represent the kilos on a range of 81 - 76 + 1 = 6 kg, starting from `rangeKilo.min` - 1 = 75 kg to 75 + 6 = 81 kg

The height of a bar representing 80 kg will be `kilo_hscale * (80 - 76 + 1)`. More generally the height of a bar representing `d.kilogram` will be `kilo_hscale * (d.kilogram - rangeKilo.min + 1)`, while the
height of a bar representing `d.calories` will be `calo_hscale * d.calories` because the calories are represented on the full range.

## Showing the selection rectangle and the tooltip

To avoid flickering, we first draw hidden 'background' gray selection rectangles, then we draw the histogram bars and finally we draw
over the 'background' gray rectangles the hidden rectangles of the same size that will accept mouse events. When the mouse is going to enter
a hidden 'foreground' selection rectangle, the 'background' corresponding gray rectangle will be made visible.

### Getting the correct corresponding 'background' gray rectangle

When entering a selection rectangle, **d3** allows us to access to the data associated to that rectangle. But we also
want to access to the 'background' corresponding gray rectangle. For this reason we added a field `count` to each data to index them.

```javascript
// we add a count field to the data that will be used to know to what day each data refers to
activities = activities.map((e, i) => {
  e.count = i;
  return e;
});
```

When the selection rectangles were created, they were assigned an `id` as follows :

```javascript
.attr('id', (d, i) => `sel-${i}`)
```

that allows us to select them using this `id` recreated from the retrieved `count` value of the data
as follows :

```javascript
const rect = d3.select(`#sel-${d.count}`);
```
