This project uses Javascript (ES7), CSS, [React](https://reactjs.org/) 18.2, [React Rooter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) 6.4, and [d3](https://d3js.org/) 7.6 and was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

A full live demo application is deployed and running at the address [https://sez5ks-4173.preview.csb.app](https://sez5ks-4173.preview.csb.app)

## Running the backend

A backend is already running by default as a demo with data for two users at [https://bz0bje-3000.preview.csb.app](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).
If you decide to use it, you can directly run the frontend.

You can also clone the backend and run it locally :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard.git
cd P9-front-end-dashboard
yarn
yarn start
```

But before running the frontend, you will have then to edit the file /src/router.jsx by uncommenting the line 38 and commenting the line 37.

Before changes :

```shell
loader: async ({ params }) =>
            loader({ params }, new API('https://bz0bje-3000.preview.csb.app')),
            // loader({ params }, new API('http://localhost:3000')),
```

After changes :

```shell
loader: async ({ params }) =>
            // loader({ params }, new API('https://bz0bje-3000.preview.csb.app')),
            loader({ params }, new API('http://localhost:3000')),
```

## Running the frontend

You can start this fontend application either in development mode with

```shell
yarn run dev
```

and then access the application in development mode at the address [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) (or the one indicated in the shell),

or you can build it in production mode with

```shell
yarn build
```

and run it in production mode with

```shell
yarn run preview
```

and then access the application in production mode at the address [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173/) (or the one indicated in the shell)

When the app is running you will see a red switch-button in the upper left corner which will allow you to switch between the data of the two users
